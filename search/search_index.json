Introduction This document outlines the monetization model for our online marketplace platform, detailing the pricing structure, fees, and the rationale behind our approach. Our platform is designed to provide a space where developers can publish and sell their applications, as well as offer free applications, which incur no costs. Below, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of our pricing model, which is crafted to ensure sustainability and profitability for both the platform and the developers. Pricing Structure Our platform operates on a commission-based model, where we take a percentage of each sale as a platform fee. This fee is variable and depends on the pricing of the application set by the developer. Tiered Commission Rates: For applications priced at \u20ac3.50 or higher, we charge a modest 8% commission fee. For applications priced below \u20ac3.50, we charge a 30% commission fee. The tiered structure is designed to encourage developers to maintain a minimum price threshold, ensuring that they receive a fair share of the revenue while also covering the costs associated with payment processing through Stripe.

By setting a higher commission rate for lower-priced apps, we mitigate the relative impact of Stripe's fees, which are more significant for lower transaction amounts. Conversely, the lower commission rate for higher-priced apps provides developers with a greater share of the revenue, incentivizing them to set prices that reflect the value of their applications.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"content/monetization/monetization/#overview","text":"NOTE This documentation site is still under constructions, so some details may not be included to this page.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"content/monetization/monetization/#introduction","text":"This document outlines the monetization model for our online marketplace platform, detailing the pricing structure, fees, and the rationale behind our approach.
