Our platform is designed to provide a space where developers can publish and sell their applications, as well as offer free applications, which incur no costs. Below, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of our pricing model, which is crafted to ensure sustainability and profitability for both the platform and the developers. Pricing Structure \u26cc Our platform operates on a commission-based model, where we take a percentage of each sale as a platform fee. This fee is variable and depends on the pricing of the application set by the developer. Tiered Commission Rates: \u26cc For applications priced at \u20ac3.50 or higher, we charge a modest 8% commission fee. For applications priced below \u20ac3.50, we charge a 30% commission fee. The tiered structure is designed to encourage developers to maintain a minimum price threshold, ensuring that they receive a fair share of the revenue while also covering the costs associated with payment processing through Stripe.
