Introduction This document outlines the monetization model for our online marketplace platform, detailing the pricing structure, fees, and the rationale behind our approach. Our platform is designed to provide a space where developers can publish and sell their applications, as well as offer free applications, which incur no costs. Below, we provide a comprehensive breakdown of our pricing model, which is crafted to ensure sustainability and profitability for both the platform and the developers. Pricing Structure Our platform operates on a commission-based model, where we take a percentage of each sale as a platform fee. This fee is variable and depends on the pricing of the application set by the developer. Tiered Commission Rates: For applications priced at \u20ac3.50 or higher, we charge a modest 8% commission fee. For applications priced below \u20ac3.50, we charge a 30% commission fee. The tiered structure is designed to encourage developers to maintain a minimum price threshold, ensuring that they receive a fair share of the revenue while also covering the costs associated with payment processing through Stripe.

By setting a higher commission rate for lower-priced apps, we mitigate the relative impact of Stripe's fees, which are more significant for lower transaction amounts. Conversely, the lower commission rate for higher-priced apps provides developers with a greater share of the revenue, incentivizing them to set prices that reflect the value of their applications.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"content/monetization/monetization/#overview","text":"NOTE This documentation site is still under constructions, so some details may not be included to this page.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"content/monetization/monetization/#introduction","text":"This document outlines the monetization model for our online marketplace platform, detailing the pricing structure, fees, and the rationale behind our approach.

Currently, we are in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage, and certain features are still being developed and refined. The original intent of this platform was for AI applications. However, the utility spans beyond AI usecases. If we can bundle it, you can publish it. \ud83c\udf10 Cross Platform yappstore.ai ensures that your applications can reach the widest audience possible by building them for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. This cross-platform capability allows your app to be accessible to a diverse range of users. \ud83d\udcb2 Monetization Developers may opt to release their app for free, or monetize them. We aim to offer a fair and developer-friendly monetization model. Key benefits include: Low Fees : Unlike other platforms that take significant cuts, yappstore.ai charges a modest fee, ensuring you retain most of your revenue. Flexible Pricing Models : You can choose to offer your applications for free, charge a one-time fee, or adopt a subscription model, depending on what suits your application best. Increased Revenue Potential : By reaching a wider audience across multiple platforms, you have the potential to increase your earnings substantially. NOTE Monetization features will be rolled out in later releases, so stay tuned for updates. \ud83d\udddd\ufe0f Security Security is a top priority at yappstore.ai. We ensure that all applications are distributed securely through several measures: Sandboxed Environment : By default, applications run in a sandboxed environment, limiting their access to the host system and ensuring that they operate securely without compromising user data. Rigorous Review Process : Applications are subject to automated and manual security checks before being published to the marketplace, ensuring they meet our stringent security standards. Continuous Monitoring : We continuously monitor applications for any potential security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, providing users with a safe and reliable platform. Data Protection : We employ robust encryption methods for data at rest and in transit, ensuring that user information is always protected. NOTE For MVP, the core focus to test developer experience with the platform, so not all security measures are currently in place. Pros of Using yappstore.ai Free to Use : Publishing applications is free, minimizing your costs and lowering the barrier to entry for your potential customers. No need to buy domain name, or pay for hosting. Once you app is built, it can be distributed as needed.

Submitting your application to yappstore.ai is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to get your application reviewed and published on our platform. 1. Syncing your GitHub Repository To bundle your project into an executable application, you must first provide access to the Yapp GitHub App. Install the Yapp GitHub App: Ensure that the Yapp GitHub App is installed in your GitHub account. Grant the necessary permissions for the Yapp GitHub App to access your repository. Sync Your Repository: In the App Submission form, click on the \"Sync GitHub Repository\" button. Select the repository you wish to sync. If you can't see your repository, ensure the GitHub App is installed and has access. For more detailed instructions, visit the GitHub App installation guide . 2. General Information Provide the general information about your project. This includes: Application Name : The name of your application. Application Subtitle : A brief subtitle (e.g., Putting the \"app\" in Yapp Store). Application Description : A detailed description of what your application does. Category : The category your application belongs to (e.g., Productivity, Education). Keywords : Comma-separated keywords to help users find your app. Privacy Policy URL : A link to your application's privacy policy. Application Listing Image : Upload an image to represent your application in the store. 3. Build Information Specify the build information for your project. This helps the YappStore backend to correctly build and bundle your application. Project Type : Select 'Web Application'. Frontend Framework : Choose the framework your application uses (e.g., React, Vue, Angular). Bundler : Specify the bundler used in your project (e.g., Webpack, Parcel). Package Manager : Select the package manager for your project (e.g., npm, yarn). Build Command : The command to build your project (e.g., npm run build). Installation Command : The command to install dependencies (e.g., npm install). Window Title : The title for your application window. Full Screen : Toggle on if you want your app to open in full screen on startup. Resizable : Toggle on if you want to allow users to resize the application window. Target Operating Systems : Select the operating systems you want your app to be available on (MacOS, Windows, Linux). Application Icon : Upload an icon for your application. 4. Permissions Permissions enable certain functionalities for your application. These will be reviewed, and you need to justify their necessity. Filesystem Access : Allows your application to read and write to an isolated location within the filesystem using the SDK. Shell : Allows your application to run shell commands via the SDK. SQLite : Allows your application to read and write to a local SQLite database via the SDK. Note: For security reasons, the more permissions you request, the longer the approval process may take. The Yapp Native SDK is still under development, so these options are currently disabled. 5. Monetization Monetization features will be available in future releases. Currently, all applications are released for free. Monetization Toggle : Leave this turned off to release your application for free. 6. Agreements Before submitting your application, you must agree to the following: Terms and Conditions : Confirm that you have read and agree to the Terms and Conditions . Safety and Security : Confirm that you have taken the necessary steps to ensure your application is safe and secure for both developers and users. Submit for Review Once all the required information is filled out, click on \"Submit for Review\". We appreciate your feedback on the developer experience, so please leave us any comments or suggestions. NOTE By taking part in the MVP, you are agreeing that your application will be freely usable by other testers and users. Do not distribute something you would currently like to monetize, as we just not there yet. Additionally, we are figuring out licensing and other security aspects for safe and secure distribution. So bear with us. We hope you had a great developer experience with yappstore.ai.
