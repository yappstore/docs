Welcome to the yappstore.ai documentation. yappstore.ai is a cross-platform marketplace for AI-powered applications, designed to support developers in building, distributing, and monetizing their software. Currently, we are in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage, and certain features are still being developed and refined. The original intent of this platform was for AI applications. However, the utility spans beyond AI usecases. If we can bundle it, you can publish it. 


## üåê Cross Platform
yappstore.ai ensures that your applications can reach the widest audience possible by building them for MacOS, Windows, and Linux. 
This cross-platform capability allows your app to be accessible to a diverse range of users.

## üí≤ Monetization
We aim to offer a fair and developer-friendly monetization model. 
Key benefits include:

- **Low Fees**: Unlike other platforms that take significant cuts, yappstore.ai charges a modest fee, ensuring you retain most of your revenue.
- **Flexible Pricing Models**: You can choose to offer your applications for free, charge a one-time fee, or adopt a subscription model, depending on what suits your application best.
- **Increased Revenue Potential**: By reaching a wider audience across multiple platforms, you have the potential to increase your earnings substantially.

???+ Example "NOTE"    
    Monetization features will be rolled out in later releases, so stay tuned for updates. 

## üóùÔ∏è Security
Security is a top priority at yappstore.ai. We ensure that all applications are distributed securely through several measures:

- **Sandboxed Environment**: By default, applications run in a sandboxed environment, limiting their access to the host system and ensuring that they operate securely without compromising user data.
- **Rigorous Review Process**: Applications are subject to automated and manual security checks before being published to the marketplace, ensuring they meet our stringent security standards.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: We continuously monitor applications for any potential security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, providing users with a safe and reliable platform.
- **Data Protection**: We employ robust encryption methods for data at rest and in transit, ensuring that user information is always protected.

???+ Example "NOTE"    
    For MVP, the core focus to test developer experience with the platform, so not all security measures are currently in place.


## Pros of Using yappstore.ai
- **Free to Use**: Publishing applications is free, minimizing your costs and lowering the barrier to entry for your potential customers.
- **Developer Focused**: Build your application how you want it to look without being confined to a specific UI format. yappstore.ai supports various frameworks and tooling to give you the freedom to innovate.
- **Built-in Search and Analytics**: Our developer portal allows you to submit apps, sync your GitHub repository, and view analytics and insights into your published apps, all in one place.
- **Rapid Distribution**: The process of app submission is streamlined for convenience. Once your application is reviewed, it can be quickly published to the marketplace.

## How to Get Started
1. **Sign in with GitHub**: Visit [developer.yappstore.ai](https://developer.yappstore.ai) and sign in using your GitHub account to create a developer account.
2. **Submit Your App**: Sync your GitHub repository within the app submission form. Configure your application requirements within the portal.
3. **Publish**: After your application goes through the review process, it is published to the marketplace. During the MVP stage, apps will be auto-approved as there's no native API access yet.

We look forward to seeing what you create with yappstore.ai!
